# Exploring Hacker News Posts

This is a guided project under Dataquest (Data Engineering track) where I analyzed a data set of submissions to Hacker News (HN), a website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. I am interested in two specific categories of user-submitted posts: `Ask HN` posts where users ask the HN community a specific question, and `Show HN` posts where users present the HN community an interesting project or product. I wanted to know the following:

* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more upvotes or points on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more points on average?
* Do posts other than `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments and points on average?

I performed the following for the data analysis:

* Opening and exploration of the `hacker_news.csv` data set
* Extraction of `Ask HN` and `Show HN` posts
* Calculation of the average number of comments for `Ask HN` and `Show HN` posts
* Determination of the number of `Ask HN` posts and comments by hour created
* Calculation of the average number of comments for `Ask HN` posts by hour
* Calculation of the average number of upvotes or points for `Ask HN` and `Show HN` posts
* Determination of the number of points by hour created for `Ask HN` posts
* Calculation of the average number of points for `Ask HN` posts by hour
* Calculation of the average number of comments and points for other posts

Results of the data analysis show that to maximize the number of comments and upvotes a post receives, the post should be categorized as an `Ask HN` post and created around 3:00 - 4:00 EST.

Please see the `hacker_news.csv` data set and the full exploratory data analysis in the Project 2.ipynb notebook above.
